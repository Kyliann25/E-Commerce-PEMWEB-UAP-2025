                HUBBUB was born in the chaos of the city. We are not just a brand; we are a movement. Inspired by the raw energy of street culture, underground music, and modern art, we create apparel that speaks louder than words.
            </p>
            <p>
                Founded in 2025, our mission has always been clear: to provide high-quality, distinctive streetwear for those who dare to stand out. We believe that fashion is the ultimate form of self-expression.

            <h2 class="font-header text-3xl font-bold uppercase text-hubbub-black mt-12 mb-6">Our Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                We don't follow trends; we set them. Every piece in our collection is designed with an obsession for detail and a passion for authenticity. From our fabrics to our fits, nothing is accidental.
            </p>
            <h2 class="font-header text-3xl font-bold uppercase text-hubbub-black mt-12 mb-6">Join the Noise</h2>
            <p>
                Hubbub is for the disruptors, the creators, and the visionaries. When you wear Hubbub, you're not just wearing clothes—you're making a statement.
